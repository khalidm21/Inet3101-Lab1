- Khalid Mohamed

Simple Program that store details of parts and puts them in a databse. I mainly used character arrays to store the database. The max amount of parts it can hold is 100

The menu when program is run
1. Print all records
2. Add record
3. Delete the last record
4. Print number of records
5. Print database size
6. Print number of changes
7. Exit the Program

Steps.
1. chooose a choice
2. return to menu
3. choose another choice or exit
## Function Definitions

1.Print all records
- Loops through the database arrays and prints the details of each part.

2. Add record
  - Prompts the user for part details (
    -number, name, size, size metric, and cost
  - Stores the input in the respective arrays.
  - Increments the count of records.

3. Delete the last record
  - Decrements the count of records if possible
  - Prints a confirmation message.

4. Print number of records
  - Prints the current count of records.

5. Print database size  *not implemented for this lab
  - Displays databse current size
  - Prints a placeholder message indicating the function is called
        - will probaly be used in lab 2

6. Print number of changes
  - Uses a static variable to track and print the number of changes to the database.

`main.c` - Contains the main function and all other function implementations.

Those are the design ideas behind the functions in the part manager
